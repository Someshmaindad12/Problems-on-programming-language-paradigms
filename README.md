# Problems-on-programming-language-paradigms

In this topic I applyed the three different programming language paradigms as Sequence , Selection , Iteration

Sequence : Write the code in sequencial format In Sequence there is no any kind of special syntax .

Selectionn : Select one execution path from multiple options There are mainly three options with that options we can use the concept of selection 1 . if else 2. if else if ladder 3. switch case

Iteration : Executing one or more lines of code multiple times There are mainly three options with that options we can use the concept of Iteration 1. for loop 2. while loop 3. do-while loop
